This seems to be the new normal.</p><p>After saying <a href=https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/01/happy-new-year-2022/>last year</a> that I wanted to post here more often, I managed two whole articles in 2022: a <a href=https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/01/games-played-2021/>look at the games I had enjoyed playing in 2021</a>, and a <a href=https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/09/sports-watches/>review of the Garmin Fenix 7S</a> sports watch. No promises for 2023&mldr;</p><p>I did manage to read 11 books last year. Compared to my youth this is pathetic, but I&rsquo;m trying to get back into it. The ongoing destruction of Twitter by an alt-right man-child has probably helped if I&rsquo;m honest. Best book of the year was probably <a href=http://www.nickharkaway.com/books/gnomon/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Gnomon</a> by Nick Harkaway. I&rsquo;m also re-reading the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos target=_blank rel=noopener>Hyperion Cantos</a> by Dan Simmons - some of the best SciFi ever written.</p><p>Speaking of SciFi, one of the best TV adaptations I&rsquo;ve seen came to Amazon Prime - The Peripheral, from the book by William Gibson. This was a high bar to reach as Gibson is one of my favourite authors and the book is loved by his fans. The changes to plotting were fair and the cast and staging superb. Given the cliffhanger ending it&rsquo;s to be hoped that a second season is rapidly commissioned.</p><p>I still have an account on Twitter, but <a href=https://hachyderm.io/@jonsaville target=_blank rel=noopener>Mastodon</a> is where to find me. I like Mastodon, both in principle and practice. I hope it gains enough traction to succeed at a mass scale. Some communities have migrated wholesale (infosec being one), but others are lagging.</p><p>2023 promises to be busy and weird, again. All the best!</p></p></div></div></div><div class=pagination><ul class=pagination><li class="pagination__item pagination__item--current"><a href=/post/ class=pagination__link><div class=pagination-icon>1</div></a></li><li class=pagination__item><a href=/post/page/2/ class=pagination__link><div class=pagination-icon>2</div></a></li><li class=pagination__item><a href=/post/page/3/ class=pagination__link><div class=pagination-icon>3</div></a></li><li class="pagination__item pagination__item--next"><a href=/post/page/2/ class="pagination__link pagination__link--next"><div class=pagination-icon><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i></div></a></li><li class="pagination__item pagination__item--last"><a class="pagination__link pagination__link--last" href=/post/page/3/><div class=pagination-icon><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i></div></a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class=footer><div class=by_farbox>All content is &copy; Jon Saville 2026. <a href=/credits/>Site credits.</a></div></div></div></body></html>
