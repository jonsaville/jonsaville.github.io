So here we are.</p><p>It&rsquo;s over 20 years since I first started hosting a website at a domain I controlled on a server I also controlled. Then, as now, it was less about the content (obviously) than the process - learning what worked and what didn&rsquo;t - and inching towards some platonic ideal of efficiency and automation.</p><p>Hosting both web and email was challenging but fun in those early days, especially for someone like me who enjoys getting down to the bare metal. Like most things it has become cheaper and easier over time, but also more beholden to a few giant corporations.</p><p>Here is some chronology - going back through emails and invoices, it amazes me how much has changed in a relatively short time. Most of the companies involved have long since been consumed by the relentless pace of innovation and commerce. I&rsquo;ve included basic potted histories culled largely from Wikipedia, but errors and omissions are all mine of course.</p><h3 id=2001-pre-history>2001: pre-history</h3><div class=aside><div class=asideMain><p><p>I signed up with legendary ISP <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Internet target=_blank rel=noopener>Demon Internet</a> in 1996. Demon gave you a personalised <em>subdomain.demon.co.uk</em> and the ability to host a website. Thus my first public website went live in 2001.</p><p>The 1990s was a dial-up era, although for the last couple of years of the last millennium my flatmate and I had British Telecom&rsquo;s home ISDN offering - Home Highway. This offered what the Guardian described at the time as &ldquo;<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926051738/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/1997/nov/08/news.internet target=_blank rel=noopener>Lightning-fast 128K connections</a>&rdquo;. In truth it still didn&rsquo;t feel very fast, but it was reliable and connected almost instantly. Thankfully, ADSL was just around the corner.</p></p></div><div class=asideSide><div class=asideSideInner><strong>Demon Internet</strong> was founded in 1992 and bought by Scottish Telecom in 2007. Scottish Telecom was rebranded as Thus in 1999 and floated, before being bought by Cable and Wireless in 2008, which in turn was bought by Vodafone in 2012. The last remaining Demon-branded accounts were migrated to Vodafone services in 2019.</div></div></div><h3 id=2003-early-doors>2003: early doors</h3><div class=aside><div class=asideMain><p><p>In 2003 I registered the jonsaville.com domain name, took a VPS package from 1&amp;1 Internet, and started running my own web (Apache) and email (Exim) servers. This general setup continued throughout the various hosting incarnations below until 2017 when I finally stopped banging my head against the wall and moved my email to Microsoft 365 and hosting to AWS S3.</p><p>Email spam existed in 2003 but was manageable. You could also relay to other big email hosts without too much fuss - but over time, sites like Hotmail began to reject email from smaller hosts. Today email is almost a closed shop of the big providers. Perhaps it has to be like that to manage the torrent of spam and phishing email, although it&rsquo;s another way in which the amateur internet is disappearing.</p></p></div><div class=asideSide><div class=asideSideInner><strong>1&amp;1 Internet</strong> was founded in Germany in 1988 and expanded rapidly. It became <a href=https://www.ionos.co.uk/about target=_blank rel=noopener>IONOS</a> in a 2018 merger, which in turn was floated by parent company United Internet in 2023.</div></div></div><h3 id=2004---2007-co-location>2004 - 2007: co-location</h3><div class=aside><div class=asideMain><p><p>1&amp;1 were fine, but I was getting used to managing my own server and decided to go the next step and have a physical server in a rack. I bought a bare-bones SuperMicro 1U server and built a separate 1U firewall and co-located with Black Cat Networks. Black Cat was run by lovely people, and they had a point of presence at Redbus Interhouse in London Docklands. Short of being in the <a href=https://www.linx.net/ target=_blank rel=noopener>LINX</a> building itself, it was hard to be closer to the centre of the UK Internet in 2004.</p><p>With co-lo you typically had a power budget to think about in additional to bandwidth. Having a remote co-lo server also raises the management stakes - no-one wants to have to visit their datacentre because they&rsquo;ve bricked a server, and it taught me a lot about checking everything twice before hitting Enter.</p></p></div><div class=asideSide><div class=asideSideInner><strong>Black Cat</strong> seems to have disappeared around 2009. <strong>Redbus Interhouse</strong> was founded in 1998 and bought in 2006 by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TelecityGroup target=_blank rel=noopener>Telecity</a>, another early datacentre pioneer. The Telecity name lived on until finally being consumed by <a href=https://www.equinix.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Equinix</a> in 2015.</div></div></div><h3 id=2008---2012-vps-merrygoround>2008 - 2012: VPS merrygoround</h3><div class=aside><div class=asideMain><p><p>Hosting a physical server eventually became too expensive to justify, and I spent the next few years bouncing between various virtual server companies, including Webfusion, VPS.net (WebHosting.uk), Xensmart (PCSmart Group) and Slicehost.</p><p>VPS hosting was becoming a race to the bottom, and a larger threat to small hosting companies was looming on the horizon.</p></p></div><div class=asideSide><div class=asideSideInner><strong>Slicehost</strong> was bought by Rackspace in 2008 and the name killed off a few years later. <strong>VPS.net</strong> was launched in 2010 as a brand of UK2 Group. Eventually UK2 was bought by THG plc and renamed <a href=https://www.ingenuitycloudservices.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>THG Ingenuity Cloud Services</a>. <strong>Webfusion</strong> has a complicated history, starting as GX Networks in 1997. GX bought the UK&rsquo;s first commercial ISP, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipex target=_blank rel=noopener>Pipex</a>, in 2003 and traded for a period as Pipex Communications. GX was renamed again to Host Europe Group in 2009, and several acquisitions later was finally bought by their current owner GoDaddy in 2016. Many of these brands are still trading in different parts of the world. <strong>Xensmart</strong> is a brand of PCSmart Group, founded in 2006.</div></div></div><h3 id=2012---2017-aws-land>2012 - 2017: AWS land</h3><div class=aside><div class=asideMain><p><p><a href=https://aws.amazon.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Amazon Web Services</a> launched its first cloud services in 2006: EC2 (virtual machines) and S3 (object storage). I started experimenting with the new services shortly thereafter, and in 2012 began hosting full-time on a series of Linux VMs.</p><p>In those early days, AWS grew steadily, adding services and datacentres around the world.</p></p></div><div class=asideSide><div class=asideSideInner>Famously, the origin story of <strong>AWS</strong> was the desire to commercialise their efforts in migrating their internal technology stack to a service-oriented architecture. This proved to be a good decision: in 2022, AWS made <a href=https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2023/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/ target=_blank rel=noopener>$2.6m in profit</a> <em>every hour</em>.</div></div></div><h3 id=2017---2023-corporate-takeover>2017 - 2023: corporate takeover</h3><p>From 2008 to 2020 I spent a lot of time consulting on transport projects in the Middle East. Amongst other things, this made supporting my own web and email servers difficult. So in 2017 I took the (probably overdue) decision to move both to a corporate solution.</p><p>Email was easy - everything moved to <a href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365 target=_blank rel=noopener>Microsoft 365</a>. M365 offers a surprising level of customisation even on basic subscriptions (it is Exchange under the hood, after all), and gave me all the flexibility I enjoyed with self-hosting.</p><p>My web sites had always been static, more or less, so it made sense to use a static site generator and host the pages on <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/s3/ target=_blank rel=noopener>AWS S3</a>. I tried <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Jekyll</a> and a few others before settling on <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Hugo</a>. To S3 I added their content distribution service <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Cloudfront</a>, which includes free SSL certificates.</p><p>Initially I was building the pages at home and uploading them to S3 manually, but looking to automate the build process I moved the source to <a href=https://github.com target=_blank rel=noopener>Github</a> and used a CI/CD service to automatically build and push the pages to S3 - settling on <a href=https://buddy.works/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Buddy</a>.</p><h3 id=today-github-nirvana>Today: Github nirvana</h3><p>The web hosting setup of Github -> automation service -> AWS S3 worked well, but I had a few niggles. One major issue with AWS is that it has no usage cutoffs. Their services were absurdly cheap for this scenario, but there was always the theoretical possibility of a DOS attack that might trigger large bills. A second concern was Buddy.works as automation service. They have a great offer, but free tiers are intended as a gateway to paid subscriptions - and they make it slightly difficult to just set up a pipeline and forget about it. This is completely reasonable.</p><p>Hence this website is now hosted completely on <a href=https://pages.github.com target=_blank rel=noopener>Github Pages</a>, as of 2023. It is very difficult to argue with their deal of zero cost, for which you can assign a custom domain and benefit from build actions and all the other features of Github.</p><p>The site uses <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Hugo</a> to convert the layout and markdown files to the final, static pages. The build process happens automatically whenever a change is pushed to the repository. Github natively supports Jekyll, but I switched to Hugo before moving to Github, and I&rsquo;m comfortable with it.</p></div><div class=pageNavigation><div class=nextPost></div><div class=previousPost><a href="https://jonsaville.com/post/2024/01/happy-new-year-2024/?ref=footer">Happy New Year 2024 <i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden=true></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><div class=footer><div class=by_farbox>&copy; Jon Saville 2024. <a href=/credits/>Site credits.</a></div></div></div></body></html>
