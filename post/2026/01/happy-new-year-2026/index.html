The atmosphere that VanderMeer conjures is deeply unsettling, and highlights how most stories of first contact with alien species assumes that we will eventually understand and be able to contextualise the experience. Instead, this first contact is baffling, unexplained, orthogonal. The film is a loose adaptation, but if anything is more dreamlike and strange than the novel.</p><a class="galleryImage onPost" href=#image2><figure class="figTall figLeft figThumbnail copyright" id=#inlineimage2><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='/post/2026/01/happy-new-year-2026/TheseBurningStars_hu_96ee6aba5398ec6b.jpg 200w

The book has a measured pace for most of its length, slowly revealing details of the mysterious ministry and the larger conspiracy, but the final act feels rushed, with several infodumps which feel at odds with the care taken to that point, and which confuse rather than explain the preceding events.</p><a class="galleryImage onPost" href=#image4><figure class="figTall figLeft figThumbnail copyright" id=#inlineimage4><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='/post/2026/01/happy-new-year-2026/VelocityWeapon_hu_91863f2e12d886cc.jpg 200w
