&lt;p>2024 was a big year for my family - my sister got married, my parents downsized from the house I grew up in, and I turned 50 during a holiday in the Scottish Highlands. That holiday coincided with the solar storm in May, and we were treated to a spectacular aurora display in spectacular surroundings. 2025 promises to be just as busy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The last 18 months have been hectic to say the least, but a post on Mastodon reminded me not to worry too much about this site.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have a few posts queued so we&amp;rsquo;ll see how quickly they are published. The rest of 2024 promises to be busy as well, so in the meantime I am enjoying this beautiful part of the world with Lindsey, drinking a little whisky, and not worrying too much about the outside world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy New Year 2023</title><link>https://jonsaville.com/post/2023/01/happy-new-year-2023/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonsaville.com/post/2023/01/happy-new-year-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well 2022 continued to be weird in lots of unhelpful ways. This seems to be the new normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After saying &lt;a href="https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/01/happy-new-year-2022/">last year&lt;/a> that I wanted to post here more often, I managed two whole articles in 2022: a &lt;a href="https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/01/games-played-2021/">look at the games I had enjoyed playing in 2021&lt;/a>, and a &lt;a href="https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/09/sports-watches/">review of the Garmin Fenix 7S&lt;/a> sports watch. No promises for 2023&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did manage to read 11 books last year. Compared to my youth this is pathetic, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get back into it. The ongoing destruction of Twitter by an alt-right man-child has probably helped if I&amp;rsquo;m honest. Best book of the year was probably &lt;a href="http://www.nickharkaway.com/books/gnomon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gnomon&lt;/a> by Nick Harkaway. I&amp;rsquo;m also re-reading the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperion Cantos&lt;/a> by Dan Simmons - some of the best SciFi ever written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of SciFi, one of the best TV adaptations I&amp;rsquo;ve seen came to Amazon Prime - The Peripheral, from the book by William Gibson. This was a high bar to reach as Gibson is one of my favourite authors and the book is loved by his fans. The changes to plotting were fair and the cast and staging superb. Given the cliffhanger ending it&amp;rsquo;s to be hoped that a second season is rapidly commissioned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still have an account on Twitter, but &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@jonsaville" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastodon&lt;/a> is where to find me. I like Mastodon, both in principle and practice. I hope it gains enough traction to succeed at a mass scale. Some communities have migrated wholesale (infosec being one), but others are lagging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2023 promises to be busy and weird, again. All the best!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy New Year 2022</title><link>https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/01/happy-new-year-2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/01/happy-new-year-2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>I wrote &lt;a href="https://jonsaville.com/post/2021/01/happy-new-year/">last year&lt;/a> that 2020 was a weird and difficult year, and 2021 doubled down on that. The year was very busy work-wise, but there was a relentless quality to the pandemic as Covid ebbed and flowed that ground down my enthusiasm. I&amp;rsquo;ve always tried to use social media to highlight positive news, but that approach took a battering last year, especially as politics continued to diverge from reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s now 22 months since I travelled outside the UK - by far the longest period since university. Although air travel is not exactly sustainable, my experiences travelling for work and pleasure have been very formative, and the sudden halt with few signs of recovery has required some mental readjustment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously I didn&amp;rsquo;t post here as often as I wanted. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to improve on that in 2022, and have a very full slate this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take care of yourselves and be kind.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy New Year 2021</title><link>https://jonsaville.com/post/2021/01/happy-new-year/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonsaville.com/post/2021/01/happy-new-year/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the area of New Year resolutions, this seemed like a good opportunity to update my personal site, which has offered just a single page for the last few years. The intention is to post more updates on more subjects, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how normal life interferes with that goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2020 was a weird and difficult year, and we are not out of the woods yet. Today also marks the completion of the UK&amp;rsquo;s withdrawal from Europe. Speaking personally, as someone who has travelled and worked across Europe, I find this sad, damaging and retrograde. Obviously those contacts can continue, but the theatre of a political divorce, not to mention the economic impact, seems ridiculous given the global issues we all face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky to travel extensively throughout my career. This almost completely stopped in 2020 and is unlikely to return to previous levels, which has prompted me to look back over the photos taken in some of these countries. Hopefully some of these will make it onto the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The site still uses &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo&lt;/a>, but with a new theme. See the &lt;a href="https://jonsaville.com/credits/">credits&lt;/a> page for more details on how the site is built. There&amp;rsquo;s obviously more work to do - the mobile version is broken, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to remove external dependencies.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
