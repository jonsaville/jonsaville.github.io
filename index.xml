&lt;p>2024 was a big year for my family - my sister got married, my parents downsized from the house I grew up in, and I turned 50 during a holiday in the Scottish Highlands. That holiday coincided with the solar storm in May, and we were treated to a spectacular aurora display in spectacular surroundings. 2025 promises to be just as busy.&lt;/p>

So here we are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s over 20 years since I first started hosting a website at a domain I controlled on a server I also controlled. Then, as now, it was less about the content (obviously) than the process - learning what worked and what didn&amp;rsquo;t - and inching towards some platonic ideal of efficiency and automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hosting both web and email was challenging but fun in those early days, especially for someone like me who enjoys getting down to the bare metal. Like most things it has become cheaper and easier over time, but also more beholden to a few giant corporations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy New Year 2024</title><link>https://jonsaville.com/post/2024/01/happy-new-year-2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonsaville.com/post/2024/01/happy-new-year-2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>Okay so this is a cheat - I&amp;rsquo;m writing this in May 2024, in the Highlands of Scotland, in glorious sunshine, shortly after the amazing aurora display and shortly before my fiftieth birthday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last 18 months have been hectic to say the least, but a post on Mastodon reminded me not to worry too much about this site.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have a few posts queued so we&amp;rsquo;ll see how quickly they are published. The rest of 2024 promises to be busy as well, so in the meantime I am enjoying this beautiful part of the world with Lindsey, drinking a little whisky, and not worrying too much about the outside world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy New Year 2023</title><link>https://jonsaville.com/post/2023/01/happy-new-year-2023/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonsaville.com/post/2023/01/happy-new-year-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well 2022 continued to be weird in lots of unhelpful ways. This seems to be the new normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After saying &lt;a href="https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/01/happy-new-year-2022/">last year&lt;/a> that I wanted to post here more often, I managed two whole articles in 2022: a &lt;a href="https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/01/games-played-2021/">look at the games I had enjoyed playing in 2021&lt;/a>, and a &lt;a href="https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/09/sports-watches/">review of the Garmin Fenix 7S&lt;/a> sports watch. No promises for 2023&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did manage to read 11 books last year. Compared to my youth this is pathetic, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get back into it. The ongoing destruction of Twitter by an alt-right man-child has probably helped if I&amp;rsquo;m honest. Best book of the year was probably &lt;a href="http://www.nickharkaway.com/books/gnomon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gnomon&lt;/a> by Nick Harkaway. I&amp;rsquo;m also re-reading the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperion Cantos&lt;/a> by Dan Simmons - some of the best SciFi ever written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of SciFi, one of the best TV adaptations I&amp;rsquo;ve seen came to Amazon Prime - The Peripheral, from the book by William Gibson. This was a high bar to reach as Gibson is one of my favourite authors and the book is loved by his fans. The changes to plotting were fair and the cast and staging superb. Given the cliffhanger ending it&amp;rsquo;s to be hoped that a second season is rapidly commissioned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still have an account on Twitter, but &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@jonsaville" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastodon&lt;/a> is where to find me. I like Mastodon, both in principle and practice. I hope it gains enough traction to succeed at a mass scale. Some communities have migrated wholesale (infosec being one), but others are lagging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2023 promises to be busy and weird, again. All the best!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sports watches and the Apple Watch Ultra</title><link>https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/09/sports-watches/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/09/sports-watches/</guid><description>&lt;a class="galleryImage onPost" href="#image0">

&lt;p>After a lot of research and procrastination, I finally bought a sports watch earlier this year. Pictured here, it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/735626/pn/010-02539-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garmin Fenix 7S Solar (black)&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with it, but was curious when rumours of Apple&amp;rsquo;s new sports watch began to surface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 02 October 2022 - early reviews have largely confirmed the positive and negative points I discuss in this post, and most seem to agree that the Ultra is both pretty big, and aimed primarily at smartwatch users who want an upgrade from the Apple Watch in terms of battery life and rugged design.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/65598/apple-watch-ultra-is-beautiful-rugged-and-repairability-is-just-within-reach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teardown by iFixit&lt;/a> shows the battery capacity at 2.1 Wh - identical to Garmin&amp;rsquo;s biggest watch, the 51mm &lt;a href="http://www.f-blog.info/garmin-fenix-7x-solar-teardown-non-destructive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fenix 7X&lt;/a>, which runs a month of normal use and somewhere around 100 hours of full GPS. My 42mm Fenix 7S battery is 42% of the Ultra&amp;rsquo;s capacity and has similar GPS endurance - as you might expect, given the different experience the Ultra is offering.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Games played in 2021</title><link>https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/01/games-played-2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonsaville.com/post/2022/01/games-played-2021/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here are the five games I played the most in 2021, all on the PC. Two were bought from Steam but the rest are from Xbox Game Pass, which continues to represent excellent value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I mentioned in my review of &lt;a href="https://jonsaville.com/post/2021/12/halo-infinite/">Halo Infinite&lt;/a>, I don&amp;rsquo;t get much time to play these days. I have a large queue of games I&amp;rsquo;m itching to try this year, including Control and Death Stranding.&lt;/p>

The year was very busy work-wise, but there was a relentless quality to the pandemic as Covid ebbed and flowed that ground down my enthusiasm. I&amp;rsquo;ve always tried to use social media to highlight positive news, but that approach took a battering last year, especially as politics continued to diverge from reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s now 22 months since I travelled outside the UK - by far the longest period since university. Although air travel is not exactly sustainable, my experiences travelling for work and pleasure have been very formative, and the sudden halt with few signs of recovery has required some mental readjustment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously I didn&amp;rsquo;t post here as often as I wanted. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to improve on that in 2022, and have a very full slate this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take care of yourselves and be kind.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Currently playing: Halo Infinite campaign</title><link>https://jonsaville.com/post/2021/12/halo-infinite/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonsaville.com/post/2021/12/halo-infinite/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m playing the Halo Infinite campaign and thoroughly enjoying it.

&lt;p>This was an experiment to decode the SPI data sent from a Pico to a &lt;a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TFT display&lt;/a> from Pimoroni, using my &lt;a href="https://jonsaville.com/post/2021/02/new-test-gear/">recent purchase&lt;/a> - the Siglent SDS1104X-E oscilloscope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To generate some test data, I modified the sample program supplied with the display to place four blocks of colour in the corners. These colour blocks are rotated every 10 seconds.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New test gear: Oscilloscope and signal generator</title><link>https://jonsaville.com/post/2021/02/new-test-gear/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonsaville.com/post/2021/02/new-test-gear/</guid><description>&lt;p>I finally gave in and bought an oscilloscope, the &lt;a href="https://www.siglenteu.com/digital-oscilloscopes/sds1000x-e-series-super-phosphor-oscilloscopes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siglent SDS1104X-E&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Raspberry Pi Pico &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-silicon-pico-now-on-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement&lt;/a> was very interesting, not least for the price of $4. I ordered one the next day, and here is the Pico running a demo on Pimoroni&amp;rsquo;s cute 1.14&amp;quot; &lt;a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPS display&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

The intention is to post more updates on more subjects, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how normal life interferes with that goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2020 was a weird and difficult year, and we are not out of the woods yet. Today also marks the completion of the UK&amp;rsquo;s withdrawal from Europe. Speaking personally, as someone who has travelled and worked across Europe, I find this sad, damaging and retrograde. Obviously those contacts can continue, but the theatre of a political divorce, not to mention the economic impact, seems ridiculous given the global issues we all face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky to travel extensively throughout my career. This almost completely stopped in 2020 and is unlikely to return to previous levels, which has prompted me to look back over the photos taken in some of these countries. Hopefully some of these will make it onto the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The site still uses &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo&lt;/a>, but with a new theme. See the &lt;a href="https://jonsaville.com/credits/">credits&lt;/a> page for more details on how the site is built. There&amp;rsquo;s obviously more work to do - the mobile version is broken, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to remove external dependencies.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
